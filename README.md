# Digital-Clock-Design-using-Verilog
Designed and implemented a digital clock using Verilog in Quartus II, simulating and verifying functionality on a Cyclone II FPGA. Developed clock division, time synchronization, and display logic for real-time hour, minute, and second updates. Ensured accuracy through simulation and hardware testing.
